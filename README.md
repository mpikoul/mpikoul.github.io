## Description
DOScord is a theme that attempts to recreate the look and feel of 80s 8-bit computers and their operating systems.

## Installation
Download this [file](https://github.com/mpikoul/mpikoul.github.io/blob/main/DOScord/Code/DOScord.theme.css). Assuming you have Better Discord installed, navigate to Discord Settings -> Themes, and click the "Open Theme Folder" button. Now, drag and drop the downloaded CSS file into the folder that opens up in your file navigator. Then, go back to Discord and toggle the theme so it gets activated!

If you need help contact me or join the Better Discord server for help.

## Technical Info
The font is IBM EGA 9x14 in .woff format. The code block font is IBM MGA. All the SVG changes are edited paths. 
Edited complex paths, shapes, and .pngs will be added in a future release.
